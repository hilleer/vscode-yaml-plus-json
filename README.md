Easily convert YAML to JSON or vice versa. Conversion can be done by each individual file or by all files in a folder.

Any good ideas or feature requests? Please, do not hesitate to open [a new issue](https://github.com/hilleer/vscode-yaml-plus-json/issues/new)!

## Features and usage

* **Convert a single file:**
  * Convert a YAML file to JSON by right clicking it and selecting `Convert to JSON`.
  * Convert a YAML file to JSON by changing file extension to `.json`.
  * Convert a JSON file to YAML by right clicking it and selecting `Convert to YAML`.
  * Convert a JSON file to YAML by changing file extension to `.yaml` or `.yml`.
* **Convert selection as preview:**
  * Convert YAML selection as preview by using command `YAML+JSON: Preview as JSON (from YAML. Opens in new file)`
  * Convert JSON selection as preview by using command `YAML+JSON: Preview as YAML (from JSON. Opens in new file)`
* **Convert text selection:**
  * Convert YAML selection by using command `Convert selection to JSON` - _does not_ change file extension.
  * Convert JSON selection by using command `Convert selection to YAML` - _does not_ change file extension.
* **Converting multiple files:**
  * Convert a selection of JSON files to YAML by right clicking one of the selected files and selecting `Convert selected files to YAML`.
  * Convert a selection of YAML files to JSON by right clicking one of the selected files and selecting `Convert selected files to JSON`.
  * Convert YAML files in a directory to JSON by right clicking the directory and selecting `Convert YAML files to JSON`.
  * Convert JSON files in a directory to YAML by right clicking the directory and selecting `Convert JSON files to YAML`.

* Reverting converted files: When a file has been reverted, a _"revert"_ prompt will be shown to revert it. Using this will return the entirety of the original file, including YAML comments.
* Overwriting existent files: When trying to convert a file into a destination that already exist, you can use the `overwriteExistentFiles` configuration to overwrite such. **Notice** if you use the revert feature after overwriting a file, the extension cannot (currently) revert the overwritten file. Also, due to limitation in vscode of active user prompts, if you set it to `"ask"` you will only be prompted to overwrite N number of files, while others will be skipped.

## Config

All configurations should be defined in `yaml-plus-json` in vscode settings (e.g. `.vscode/settings.json`), like:

```json
{
  "yaml-plus-json": {
    "convertOnRename": true,
    "yamlIndent": 2,
    "fileExtensions": {
      "yaml": ".yaml",
      "json": ".json"
    }
  }
}
```
