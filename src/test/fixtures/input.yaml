name: Titanium.UI.iOS.BlurView
summary: |
    A <Titanium.UI.iOS.BlurView> object gives you an easy way implement some complex visual effects.
    The blur effect is applied to every view the blur view is added to by default. You can also place the
    blur view above other views and all visible views layered under the blur view are blurred as well.
    For more information on BlurView, please refer to the official [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uivisualeffectview).
    Note: Apple introduced two new constants <Titanium.UI.iOS.BLUR_EFFECT_STYLE_REGULAR> and <Titanium.UI.iOS.BLUR_EFFECT_STYLE_PROMINENT> in
    iOS 10. These are internally mapped to <Titanium.UI.iOS.BLUR_EFFECT_STYLE_LIGHT> and <Titanium.UI.iOS.BLUR_EFFECT_STYLE_EXTRA_LIGHT>.
